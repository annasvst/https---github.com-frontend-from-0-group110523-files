# Tips for Github profile

- Have a clear name, username and a bio. Introduce yourself, your tech stack, the projects you're passionate about, and maybe a little about your personal interests. This is your chance to make a solid first impression, so consider adding a mix of professionalism and personality.

- Pin Your Best Repositories (up to six) to your profile. 
Choose projects that best showcase your skills and range, including personal projects, contributions to open-source, and anything relevant to the jobs you're targeting.

- Add Detailed Project Readmes
For each project, ensure the Readme file is thorough and well-documented. Include the project's purpose, the technologies used, how to set it up/run it, and any challenges you overcame. Screenshots or demos are a huge plus, as they visually demonstrate what you've built.

- Commit History
Active, consistent commit histories show you’re regularly working on projects. This doesn't mean you need to stress about daily commits—quality over quantity—but a healthy, consistent history suggests dedication and passion for coding.

- Personal Branding
Keep a consistent personal brand across your GitHub and professional network profiles (like LinkedIn). Use the same profile picture, bio, and include links to your professional network profiles on your GitHub Readme.
